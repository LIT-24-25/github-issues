# Get project import info API returns empty task_ids 
State: [open]
**Describe the bug**
When calling the Get Project Import Info API (GET /api/projects/:id/imports/:import_pk), the response contains an empty task_ids list, even though the imported task is visible in the Label Studio UI.

This issue causes problems when trying to automate task import verification and retrieve task IDs programmatically.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

- Use the Create Task API (POST /api/projects/:id/import) to import new tasks.
- Call the Get Import Info API (GET /api/projects/:id/imports/:import_pk) to retrieve details about the import operation.
- Observe that while the "tasks" field contains the imported task details, the "task_ids" field is empty ([]).

**Expected behavior**

- The task_ids field should contain the IDs of the tasks that were imported as part of the import operation.
- This would allow users to verify the success of an import operation programmatically.


**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - Label Studio Version - 2.22.0.dev11

**Additional context**
Reproducible for multiple imports across different projects.
The imported task is visible in the Label Studio UI, but the API response does not return task IDs.
Possible API issue where task_ids are not populated correctly in the response.
