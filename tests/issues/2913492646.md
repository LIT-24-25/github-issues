# fix: LEAP-649: Saving draft on task switching 
State: [open]
This commit ensures the task ID remains consistent throughout the `onSubmitDraft` process, even while waiting for asynchronous operations.  Previously, the task ID could change during submission, leading to potential issues. This change prevents that.
