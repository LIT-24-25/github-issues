# refactor: LEAP-1289: Remove outliner FF_OUTLINER_OPTIM feature flag 
State: [open]
Eliminated all references to the `fflag_feat_front_lsdv_4620_outliner_optimization_310723_short` feature flag as its functionality is now standard. Updated relevant components, styles, and tests to simplify logic and ensure proper behavior without conditional flag checks.
