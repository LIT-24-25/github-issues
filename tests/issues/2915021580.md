You may use AI tools such as Copilot Actions to assist with writing your PR description (see https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-summary-with-github-copilot); however, an AI summary isn't enough by itself. You'll need to provide your reviewer with strong evidence that your code works as intended, which requires actually running the code and showing that it works.
