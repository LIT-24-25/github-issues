cont_2 = '''# How to plot multiple time series in same window? 
State: [open]
Hello, I want to plot 8 time series stored in same file in same row, and choose between 4 labels for classification.

But i'm getting problem importing the csv 'Problems with parsing CSV: Cannot find provided separator ",". Row 1:
URL: undefined$' what does it mean ?Hello,. . Thank you for contacting Label Studio,. . Could you please check the following suggestions in order to fix the issue you are facing, as it looks like the Label Studio can‚Äôt detect the comma separator in your CSV file. Typically, this error (‚ÄúCannot find provided separator ‚Äò,‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù) happens when:. . ‚Ä¢ The file isn‚Äôt actually comma-separated (it might have tabs or semicolons).. . ‚Ä¢ Extra quotes or mismatched quoting breaks the first line.. . ‚Ä¢ A header row is missing or unexpectedly formatted (for example, quoting the header names can sometimes cause issues).. Steps to fix this:. . 1. Check if the file is truly comma-separated. If it‚Äôs tab-separated, try adding sep="‚Äà\t" in the labeling config, or convert the file to commas.. . 2. Remove excessive quotes from the header line if they exist.. . 3. Confirm each row has the same number of fields as the header row.. . Then, to plot 8 time series for classification, you can do something like:. .     <View> <TimeSeriesLabels name="my_labels" toName="ts"> <Label value="Label1" background="red"/> <Label value="Label2" background="green"/> <Label value="Label3" background="blue"/> <Label value="Label4" background="orange"/> </TimeSeriesLabels> <TimeSeries name="ts" valueType="url" value="$csv" sep="," timeColumn="time"> <Channel column="series1" /> <Channel column="series2" /> <Channel column="series3" /> <Channel column="series4" /> <Channel column="series5" /> <Channel column="series6" /> <Channel column="series7" /> <Channel column="series8" /> </TimeSeries></View>. . Make sure the CSV columns match the ‚Äúcolumn=‚Äù attributes in the `<Channel>` tags. Once your separator matches the file format, it should properly load all eight series.. . Hope this helps!. . > Comment by Oussama Assili. > [Workflow Run](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/actions/runs/12869133408)'''
