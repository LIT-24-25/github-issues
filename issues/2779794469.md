# Bug when exporting semantic segmentation annotations with masks. 
State:[open]
When attempting to export a labeled image in my semantic segmentation project, the exported file does not match the labeled image as expected. After labeling an image with the name **61148fa2-problem_frame_0190.jpg** and the label "net," I exported the mask annotation. However, the exported file was saved as **project-10-at-2025-01-10-10-05-5b8d7102.png**, which does not indicate which original image this mask corresponds to.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

Upload the image 61148fa2-problem_frame_0190.jpg to the platform.
Label the image with the label "net" using the semantic segmentation tool.
Export the semantic segmentation mask.
The exported file is named project-10-at-2025-01-10-10-05-5b8d7102.png but does not visually indicate which image it corresponds to.

**Expected Behavior:**
The exported file should be clearly identifiable, possibly by including the original image name or ID in the file name, or providing a reference to link the mask back to the labeled image.

**Actual Behavior:**
The exported mask file name (project-10-at-2025-01-10-10-05-5b8d7102.png) does not provide any clear reference to the original image or the labels applied.
It looks like you exported in JSON format and changed the file extension from .json to .png by mistake. 
When you export you have to chose BrushLabels PNG format in the Export dialog instead of JSON. The naming will be like here: https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/src/label_studio_sdk/converter/brush.py#L152
