### Describe the reason for change
Through other investigations it was surfaced that there was an unnecessary handling of image data in memory, which included caching raw data in a Map. Storing information in a Map is dangerous for unintended memory growth to occur as Map's do not get garbage collected very easily, most times not. Further to this, there is no clear use case to not just using the browser as normal to load image data from the provided urls directly, allowing the browser heuristics to effeciently manage the memory and caching of these image requests.



#### Does this change affect performance?
Separately fetching data of the image to cache and produce a base64 DataURL is not more efficient than using the browser's baseline primitives directly. This in small sample sizes would be no difference, but larger sample sizes with greater number and filesize of images would lead to improved memory usage and performance within the application.
