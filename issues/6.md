# Converting rotated bounding boxes to YOLO is not correct. 
State:[open] when extracting rotated bounding boxes the x,y coordinates are correct and since there is no rotation in yolo format. I had to to access LS though the API to get the coordinates with the rotation and then project them back to the origin zero. No comments provided
