 2. Label studio saves the annotations with weird names in target storage. Like 2, 3 etc which went downloaded and checked will have values in json.

5.  When I try to run docker compose up for the sam2 image model it ends up with cublas error. How come a docker image too generates an error when generating a virtual machine in order to eradicate the issue of dependency overlapping. I have attached two images of terminal output please help me with these error fixations.
